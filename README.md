## 🌍 How to Start OneBlock?

### 2. Set the Spawn Point
Initialize the OneBlock area:
```
/ob set

### 🎯 Special Placeholder Modifier: _by_position
You can append _by_position to any placeholder to get information about the island at your current location instead of your own island.

Examples:
- %OB_lvl_by_position% - Shows the level of the island at your current location.
- %OB_owner_name_by_position% - Shows the owner name of the island at your current location.
- %OB_visits_by_position% - Shows the visit count of the island at your current location.
- %OB_break_on_this_lvl_by_position% - Shows blocks broken on the island at your current location.

This is especially useful when visiting other players' islands or when you want to display information about a specific island based on location rather than the player viewing the placeholder.

### 🕬 You can use placeholders in the progress bar text!
/ob progress_bar settext %OB_lvl% lvl now. Need block to next lvl %OB_need_to_lvl_up%.
